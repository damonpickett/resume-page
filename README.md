# Online Resume Builder

## V1
In an attempt to make a React page online version of my professional Resume I threw this project together. In this current iteration it is fairly bare bones but easy to adapt for yourself. To do that follow these steps:

Create the directory locally that you want to use and clone this down:

`git clone https://github.com/mpenajoia/resume-page.git`

Install the dependencies:
`npm i`

Open the files in your favorite code editor / IDE; I'm using VS Code.

Navigate to `src/info` and open the `info.json` file.

This is just a simple object in a JSON file. You can replace all the information
